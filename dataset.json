These functions can be applied to tensors to modify the output of neurons in the network. For example, the `torch.nn.ReLU()` function applies the ReLU activation to the input tensor, where all negative values are replaced by zero.

The Tanh function, which outputs values between -1 and 1, is often preferred over Sigmoid for hidden layers, as it avoids the vanishing gradient problem to some extent. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is widely used due to its simplicity and efficiency; however, it suffers from the 'dying ReLU' problem where neurons stop learning when their inputs are negative.

              "question": "What is overfitting and how can you prevent it?",
              "answer": "Overfitting occurs when a model learns the details and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the model's performance on new data. It can be prevented using techniques like cross-validation, regularization, dropout, and early stopping."

              "question": "What is the purpose of activation functions in neural networks?",

              "answer": "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) involves training multiple independent models in parallel and averaging their predictions. Boosting involves training multiple models sequentially, where each new model corrects the errors of the previous ones. Popular boosting algorithms include AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting."

              "question": "What are the key differences between batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent?",
              "answer": "Batch Gradient Descent computes the gradient using the entire training dataset, which can be slow and computationally expensive. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) computes the gradient using one training example at a time, making it faster but more noisy. Mini-batch Gradient Descent is a compromise, using small batches of data."

              "question": "What is the vanishing gradient problem in deep learning?",
              "answer": "The vanishing gradient problem occurs when gradients become extremely small as they are propagated backward through the network, making it difficult for the model to learn. This is often observed in deep networks with activation functions like Sigmoid or Tanh, which squash gradients. Solutions include using ReLU activation functions and architectures like LSTM and GRU."

              "question": "What is the role of convolutional layers in CNNs?",
              "answer": "Convolutional layers apply filters (kernels) to input images to detect spatial patterns like edges, textures, and objects. These features are then passed to subsequent layers to capture higher-level patterns, making CNNs effective for image classification and object detection."

              "answer": "Generative models learn the joint probability distribution of input-output pairs and can generate new data instances (e.g., GANs, Naive Bayes). Discriminative models learn the decision boundary between classes and focus on maximizing the conditional probability of the output given the input (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVMs)."

              "answer": "GANs consist of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates synthetic data (e.g., images), while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake data. The two networks are trained simultaneously, with the generator improving over time to create more realistic data."
